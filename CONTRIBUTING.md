# Contributing to InputVisualizer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to my project, but I'm not accepting any pull requests at this time.

I don't have time to properly manage reviewing contributions, and would like to maintain and grow this project at my own pace.

Please feel free to submit issues and bug reports if you come across something that should be added or needs fixing.

This is a fun personal project for me, so I initially added features for what I do most often.
I will do my best to listen to feedback and continue to add new stuff, but it might take time.
I appreciate your patience and support!
