# Contributing to InputVisualizer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to my project, but I'm not accepting any pull requests from outside sources at this time.
I don't have time to properly manage reviewing contributions, and simply want to maintain and grow this project on my own.

Please feel free to create Issues for features you'd like to see, and bug reports if you come across something that needs fixing.
